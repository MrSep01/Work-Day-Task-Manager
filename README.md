# Work-Day-Task-Manager-
The Work Day Scheduler is a web-based daily planner designed for business professionals. It allows users to allocate tasks from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with color-coded time blocks to indicate past, present, and future hours. Events are saved locally for persistence, and the app also offers an archival feature to revisit past schedules.
